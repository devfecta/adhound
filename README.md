## Project Details
This was a class project and an attempt to rewrite a PHP application in Java. There were key areas the class wanted to touch on, and they were development with a variety of Java frameworks, testing, security, and deployment.

- Hibernate was used to make pulling data easier from a MySQL database.
- Securtiy involved pulling any sensitive information out of the source code.
- Tests were written using JUnit.
- I also integrated PayPal's API as part of the user registration process. The integration passes some of the registration data to PayPal and sends the user to a PayPal page where they can pay for a subscription.

In the end this project was push to AWS to get some exposure to the deployment process to an AWS EC2 instance and demostration purposes.
